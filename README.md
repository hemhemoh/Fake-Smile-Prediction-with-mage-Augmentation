# Fake-Smile-Prediction-with-Image-Augmentation

This Project Predicts when a person is not giving a genuine smile.

Further work can be done on it as regards detecting the emotion someone with a neutral smile/ fake smile has. This might help curb depression/ anxiety issues to some extent as people will be encouraged to speak up.
